# [SyslogParser.py](https://faui1-gitlab.cs.fau.de/lena.voigt/diskforge/-/blob/main/DiskForge/Utility/Parser/SyslogParser.py?ref_type=heads)
The original usage of this script was to parse the syslog file.
As during the thesis the approach to parsing log files was switched most of the functionality of the script is now unused.

The only used function is:
- [remove_null_bytes()](./remove_null_bytes.md)
