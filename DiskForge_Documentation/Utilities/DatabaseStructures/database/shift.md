# shift()
The function `shift` generates database query and update statements based on input parameters.

## Parameters:
    def shift(target_timestamp, target_url, shift_factor_seconds, table, nval, where, comparison_mode):
-  target_timestamp: Unused
-  target_url: Unused
-  shift_factor_seconds: The `shift_factor_seconds` parameter in the `shift` function represents
    the amount of time (in seconds) by which you want to shift the target timestamp. This parameter is
    used to calculate the new timestamp value based on the shift factor provided
-  table: The `table` parameter in the `shift` function refers to the name of the database table
    on which the query and update operations will be performed. It specifies the table where the data is
    stored or from which data will be retrieved or updated
-  nval: The `nval` parameter typically represents the value by which you want to update a
    specific column in a database table. In the context of the provided `shift` function, it seems to be
    used as the value to be added to the existing value in the specified column during an update
    operation
-  where: The `where` parameter typically specifies the conditions that must be met for the
    query to return results or for the update to be applied. It is used to filter the data in the
    database table. The `where` parameter can include one or more conditions that must be satisfied for
    the query or update to
-  comparison_mode: The `comparison_mode` parameter likely specifies how the comparison should
    be performed in the database queries. It could be used to determine whether the comparison should be
    for equality, greater than, less than, etc. The specific values that `comparison_mode` can take
    would depend on the implementation of the `db
- **return:** The function `shift` is returning a tuple containing two database operations: a query and
    an update operation.

## Workflow:
1. Calls `db_query` to generate query
2. Calls `db_update` to generate update
3. Returns tuple
