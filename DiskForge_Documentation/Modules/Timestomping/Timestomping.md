# Timestomping
Timestomping is the act of manipulating timestamps of inodes or inside of files.
For this thesis we developed a timesomping algorithm for the ext4 file system, which can alter the timestamps of the following targets:
- [Metadata](/Modules/Timestomping/Metadata/Metadata.md)
- [Logfiles](/Modules/Timestomping/Logfiles/Logfiles.md)
- [Databases](/Modules/Timestomping/Databases/Databases.md)
