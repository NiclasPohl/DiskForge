DiskForge is a framework designed for manipulating unmounted disk images in the context of digital forensics. 
This framework was developed as part of Niclas Pohl's master's thesis, which Lena Voigt supervised. 

The framework's structure is as follows:
1. Modules: The modules contain the program code for specific manipulations. Currently, some modules are available for timestomping on disk images.
2. Utilities: This encompasses all general disk image manipulation scripts.
